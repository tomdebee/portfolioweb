# portfolio
I started this project to get acquainted with angularJS and node.js. The goal is to make a dynamically sizing portfolio website that eventually uses a minimal amount of HTML code repetition by use of angularJS.

## Description
This repository contains the whole source code of my portfolio website, including artwork made by myself. 

## Theory
AngularJS defines multiple ways to dynamically load a website. This could be used in a portfolio website to enhance the user interaction and experience. In addition, unnecessary reloading of parts of the website can be avoided.

## Usage
Currently no real server-side scripting is implemented, so any and all browsers can locally open the index.html to view the website.
